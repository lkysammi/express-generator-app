        <h3 style="color:green;"><b>Reasons for choosing Centennial College</b></h3>
        The major reason for me to choose Centennial College is its reputation. Centennial College's Software Engineering Technician program is recognized worldwide. It does not only provide solid knowledge, but also emphasizes the importance of practical application that can prepare students to work in the software engineering field.<br><br>

        <h3 style="color:green;"><b>Reasons for choosing the program I enrolled in</b></h3>
        Over the past few year, I worked in an international telecommunication company, PCCW Global. Working in the training department, one of my duties is to organize training programs for my colleagues. While arranging different training for my colleagues, I have been given many opportunities to learn about various technology topics and communicate with many experts in the tech industry. I started to get interested in computer programming, that is currently experiencing enormous growth around the world. To explore more and learn the fundamentals, I started taking free online courses in my spare time. This year, with the encouragement of my parents and colleagues, I decided to go back to school and pursue my passion for software engineering.<br><br>

    <p>
        <h3 style="color:green;"><b>Life goals to achieve</b></h3>
        Upon finishing this study, I plan to pursue a software engineering career in my hometown, Hong Kong. In recent years, the Hong Kong government has started to take initiatives to push the growth of IT sectors. As technology in Hong Kong grows, it is expected to have a huge spurt in demand for software engineers. I believe that this diploma program is a wise investment to gain a competitive edge in Hong Kong job market.<br><br>
